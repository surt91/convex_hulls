# convex_hulls

This is a small collection of algorithms for the construction of convex
hulls. The implementations are built for visualization of the process and
not necessarily for fastest evaluation.

## Setup
With a working rust installation ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)),
generating visualizations is possible with
```
cargo run --release --features visual
```
